## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates a production-ready restaurant website built with **Django**. It moves beyond basic CRUD by implementing business logic specific to Japanese hospitality (*Omotenashi*), such as specific seating reservations (Omakase Counter vs Tables) and a categorized seasonal menu.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Visuals:** Grid layout with hover effects, displaying prices, descriptions, and "Spicy/Sold Out" badges.
- **Backend Management:** Easily add/remove items via Django Admin.

### 📅 Advanced Reservation
- **Split-Layout Design:** Professional UI combining visual appeal with functionality.
- **Smart Booking:** Users can select seating types:
  - *Omakase Counter* (Live Chef Experience)
  - *Private Tatami Room*
  - *Regular Table*
- **Date & Time Pickers:** Integrated browser-native widgets.

### 📰 Culinary Journal (Blog)
- **Magazine Style Layout:** Featured "Latest Story" displayed prominently with a large hero image.
- **Grid System:** Older posts automatically flow into a responsive grid.
- **Interactive:** Zoom-in animations on images and optimized typography for reading.

### 🎨 Frontend & UI/UX
- **Framework:** Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout + Custom CSS for branding.
- **Animations:** AOS (Animate On Scroll) for a smooth, premium feel.
- **Typography:** Google Fonts (*Cinzel* for headings, *Lato* for body) to convey elegance.
